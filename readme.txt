<h3>Reduce Product Comparison Times Using QODE Compare</h3>

The <a href="https://qodeinteractive.com/products/plugins/qode-compare-for-woocommerce/" target="_blank">QODE Compare for WooCommerce</a> plugin is developed to provide your customers with the supremely useful and <strong>time-saving</strong> product comparison feature.

The feature can be implemented on both <strong>product lists</strong> and <strong>single product pages</strong>.

By clicking the ‘Compare’ button found next to a specific product, the user will effectively place said items in <strong>detailed comparison tables</strong> with multiple product features presented.

This ensures your shoppers will always have an <strong>easily accessible</strong> way to directly <strong>compare products</strong> they are interested in purchasing, without the need to navigate back & forth between the two product’s respective single pages.

On top of that, the comparison feature is available to both desktop and <strong>mobile</strong> users.

<h3>“Compare” Button Behavior & Appearance Styles</h3>

You have the option to customize a large number of features relating to “Compare” buttons.

You get to pick between <strong>textual</strong> or <strong>solid</strong> button types.

If you wish to show the button icons, you can use either predefined or custom icons and choose where they appear inside the button.

You also have the option to input <strong>custom labels</strong> for the default and already added product buttons separately.

Moreover, you can select what happens when the “Compare” button is clicked – it can lead straight to the comparison page, or display the comparison table pop-up, comparison bar, comparison sidebar, side pop-up, a simple message, or it can just add the product to comparison without performing any further action.

Finally, you can also choose where you wish to <strong>position the button</strong> on both product lists and product single pages.

<h3>Easily Adjustable Comparison Table Styles and Features</h3>

The <a href="https://qodeinteractive.com/products/plugins/qode-compare-for-woocommerce/" target="_blank">QODE Compare for WooCommerce</a> provides you with a wide variety of ways of <strong>arranging and stylizing</strong> the look & content of the comparison tables.

You can input custom table labels, optional table images, product category <strong>filters</strong>, and you get to select which <strong>attributes</strong> you wish to display alongside the products in the table.

In addition to this, you can pick which <strong>product info fields</strong> you’d like to show, and make further adjustments to the table, like <strong>highlighting rows</strong> with different values or <strong>hiding rows</strong> which contain identical values.

You also have the option to omit fields with no attributes, display custom attributes, <strong>full product descriptions</strong>, additional “Price” and “Add to Cart” table fields, and more.

One more useful feature lets you show the “<strong>Clear All</strong>” and “<strong>Print</strong>” table buttons.

Last but not least, you can enable easily modifiable <strong>social sharing</strong> for comparison tables, and display eye-catching sliders with <strong>related products</strong> after comparison tables on your website.
